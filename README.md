# Supersonic_Nozzle_Design

This Program generates Supersonic Nozzle contour having rectangular cross sectional area. The design of the generated nozzle is based upon method of characteristics. This program can generate two types of nozzle: 

1) Finite Expansion Nozzle
2) Sudden Expansion Nozzle

The graph shows x-y contour of nozzle.In z-direction width is taken (i.e. in x-z plane profile will be rectangular).
While using this in any CAD software just extrude the profile equal to the width for which nozzle was designed.
